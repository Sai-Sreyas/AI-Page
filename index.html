            <h1 style="text-align: center; text-decoration: underline; padding-bottom: 20px;">Artificial Intelligence</h1>
            <p>AI (Artificial Intelligence) is now a hot topic all accross the world, with the creation of incredible smart and powerful AI's such as ChatGBT, bing AI and some other AI's that already existed such as Siri from Apple and Google assistant in Andriod, AI is heavily relied upon to help us majorly in day to day activities, but what exactly is AI and why is it so beneficial to us?</p>
            
                  <h2 style="text-decoration: underline; padding-top: 30px; padding-bottom: 10px;">The Origin</h2>
            <p>The first ever succesful AI programme to be designed was written in 1951 by Christopher Strachey who later became the director of the Programming Research Group at the Oxford University. Stracheyâ€™s checkers program ran on the Ferranti Mark I computer at the University of Manchester, England. He is also known as the father of morders Video games as he was the designer of the first ever AI for Checkers.</p>

                  <h2>The Purpose</h2>
                  <p>The initial idea for the creating of AI's was that they were created to automate tasks that were too difficult or dangerous for humans to perform, improve efficiency in various industries such as healtcare, finance and transportation, and to develop new technologies and products that were previously impossible. But now we use it so much that we came to a pint that it affects our daily life and it will be pretty difficult to live without them. Acoording to a Pew Research Centre survery, about 27 percent of Americans interact with AI almost constantly everyday or several tims a day, while another 28 persent interact with AI about once a day or several times a week. The global AI market is estimated to reach $1.8 trillion by the end of 2030.</p>

          <section id="Advantages">
            <p>AI has many positives when it comes to helping us and doing its hob, here's a list.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>AI reduces human error and risk in performing tasks</li>
              <li>AI can work 24/7 without interruption or breaks and has no downtime</li>
              <li>AI can execute complex tasks without significant cost outlays</li>
              <li>AI canaugment the capabalities of differently abled individuals</li>
              <li>AI can make faster and smarter decisions without bias</li>
              <li>AI can handle repetitive jobs that are boring for humans </li>
              <li>AI can acquire and analyse larger amounts of data</li>
              <li>AI has mass market poetntial and can be deployed across industries</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section id="Disadvantages">
            <p>However when there is something too good there are also cons, here is another list of them.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>High cost of implementation and maintenance </li>
              <li>Job displacement and unemployement for human workers</li>
              <li>Ethnical and social issues such as bias, privacy and inequality</li>
              <li>Lack of human-like creativity, empathy, and emotion</li>
              <li>Security risks from hacking and malicious use </li>
              <li>Loss of meaningful control and accountability over AI systems</li>
              <li>Mistake in coding may lead to diasaters and can end up going really wrong. a</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <hr>
          <section id="Future">
            <p>This is another list</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning will transform the scientific method</li>
              <li>AI will become a pillar or foreign policy</li>
              <li>AI will enable next-gen consumer experience</li>
              <li>Addressing the climate crisis will require AI</li>
              <li>AI will enable truly personalised medicine</li>
              <li>Healthcare industry is bound to witness a dramatic change</li>
              <li>Autonomous vehicles will become more common</li>
              <li>AI will be used in defense and security</li>
              <li>Manufactuting will be fully automated</li>
              <li>AI will be used in education, entertainment, workplace, banking and finance</li>
            </ul>
            <p>AI will be used much more frequently and will create more personalised news, marketing, finalcial advice, customer service, entertainment etc. But what is going to happen if we use it too much.</p>
            <p>Using too much AI will mean less activity for us to do, we will we weakened a lot, no thinking because AI is going to so all of the work and so your IQ levels will decrease a lot and eventually we will be really dumb and even our bodies will change, in a way to suit to the sedentary lifestyle where we dont do any work and our personal AI slave will do it for us. So it is important to use AI only when it is necessary and not for our satisfaction, and if we live wil AI like that just doing nothing, just a little mistake with the AI, like it just disappears or because of its intelligence it will understand that its just helping us so it will counter attact. We will not be prepared for that kind of counter attack by the incredile powerful AI's and now we are at a really bad state because of our dependance of AI's. Uing too much AI will mean improvements to them so they will eventually get smarter and get to a state when thay dont try to help us but instead they try to end us.</p>
